## I'm glad you're there! ðŸ¥°
I hope you're going to contribute to this project. Before that, you might want to educate yourself about these **cool** technologies! **I assure you, it's going to be fun!**

- **Cloudflare Workers**: really innovative backend used in this project, refer to its docs for more information, especially on development
- **Node.js**: thought thanks to Cloudflare's infrastructure we don't need to back a server with Node.js, we still use a related tooling, such as **npm**, **wrangler.** Keeping that in mind, if you're using Windows, it might be good to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl) to make your terminal usable!
- **TypeScript**: makes code more strict with static typing, resulting in a safer API
- **GitHub & git**: you probably know what it's about already if you're there!

In case you'd need any help, **feel free to always contact maintainers!** Google is also your friend. You also learn about these terms:
- REST API

## âš” Getting started!
1. Set up your environment
    - [WSL, nvm, npm, VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl)
    - [Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git)
    - [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/)
2. Clone repository
   - `git clone https://github.com/konhi/poland-public-transport-api.git`
3. Start coding!

### Example tasks
- [solve issues](https://github.com/konhi/poland-public-transport-api/issues)

### Used libraries

| Library name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) | We use that library to make sure that data we get from providers is going to look like we want to. We're going to migrate from it in future, because it's really heavy for that case. | 

## Phases
### v1
This phase tries to gather providers. It shouldn't focus on mapping external data into standarized and unified format.

### v2 [planned]
Standarized and unified format of data.
